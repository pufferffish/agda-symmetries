  abstract = {In Type Theory, a quotient set is a set representing a setoid. Categorically, this corresponds to the concept of an exact coequalizer. In the present paper we consider the case of a definable quotients, where the quotient set arises as the codomain of a normalization function \textemdash this corresponds to the notion of a split coequalizer. We give a number of examples of definable quotients and notice that it is preferable to use the setoid structure when reasoning about the quotient set. We also show that there are examples where setoids cannot be represented in ordinary Type Theory such as the real numbers or the partiality monad under the assumption that local continuity is admissible in Type Theory.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of defining the integers in Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT). We can define the type of integers as signed natural numbers (i.e., using a coproduct), but its induction principle is very inconvenient to work with, since it leads to an explosion of cases. An alternative is to use set-quotients, but here we need to use set-truncation to avoid non-trivial higher equalities. This results in a recursion principle that only allows us to define function into sets (types satisfying UIP). In this paper we consider higher inductive types using either a small universe or bi-invertible maps. These types represent integers without explicit set-truncation that are equivalent to the usual coproduct representation. This is an interesting example since it shows how some coherence problems can be handled in HoTT. We discuss some open questions triggered by this work. The proofs have been formally verified using cubical Agda.},

  abstract = {Homotopy type theory is an extension of Martin-L\"of type theory, based on a correspondence with homotopy theory and higher category theory. In homotopy type theory, the propositional equality type is proof-relevant, and corresponds to paths in a space. This allows for a new class of datatypes, called higher inductive types, which are specified by constructors not only for points but also for paths. In this paper, we consider a programming application of higher inductive types. Version control systems such as Darcs are based on the notion of patches\textemdash syntactic representations of edits to a repository. We show how patch theory can be developed in homotopy type theory. Our formulation separates formal theories of patches from their interpretation as edits to repositories. A patch theory is presented as a higher inductive type. Models of a patch theory are given by maps out of that type, which, being functors, automatically preserve the structure of patches. Several standard tools of homotopy theory come into play, demonstrating the use of these methods in a practical programming context.},

  abstract = {In their usual form, representation independence metatheorems provide an external guarantee that two implementations of an abstract interface are interchangeable when they are related by an operation-preserving correspondence. If our programming language is dependently-typed, however, we would like to appeal to such invariance results within the language itself, in order to obtain correctness theorems for complex implementations by transferring them from simpler, related implementations. Recent work in proof assistants has shown that Voevodsky's univalence principle allows transferring theorems between isomorphic types, but many instances of representation independence in programming involve non-isomorphic representations. In this paper, we develop techniques for establishing internal relational representation independence results in dependent type theory, by using higher inductive types to simultaneously quotient two related implementation types by a heterogeneous correspondence between them. The correspondence becomes an isomorphism between the quotiented types, thereby allowing us to obtain an equality of implementations by univalence. We illustrate our techniques by considering applications to matrices, queues, and finite multisets. Our results are all formalized in Cubical Agda, a recent extension of Agda which supports univalence and higher inductive types in a computationally well-behaved way.},

  abstract = {Following work of Ehrhard and Regnier, we introduce the notion of a differential category: an additive symmetric monoidal category with a comonad (a `coalgebra modality') and a differential combinator satisfying a number of coherence conditions. In such a category one should imagine the morphisms in the base category as being linear maps and the morphisms in the coKleisli category as being smooth (infinitely differentiable). Although such categories do not necessarily arise from models of linear logic, one should think of this as replacing the usual dichotomy of linear vs. stable maps established for coherence spaces.After establishing the basic axioms, we give a number of examples. The most important example arises from a general construction, a comonad \$S\_\textbackslash infty\$ on the category of vector spaces. This comonad and associated differential operators fully capture the usual notion of derivatives of smooth maps. Finally, we derive additional properties of differential categories in certain special cases, especially when the comonad is a storage modality, as in linear logic. In particular, we introduce the notion of a categorical model of the differential calculus, and show that it captures the not-necessarily-closed fragment of Ehrhard\textendash Regnier differential \$\textbackslash lambda\$-calculus.},

  abstract = {Differential categories were introduced to provide a minimal categorical doctrine for differential linear logic. Here we revisit the formalism and, in particular, examine the two different approaches to defining differentiation which were introduced. The basic approach used a deriving transformation, while a more refined approach, in the presence of a bialgebra modality, used a codereliction. The latter approach is particularly relevant to linear logic settings, where the coalgebra modality is monoidal and the Seely isomorphisms give rise to a bialgebra modality. Here, we prove that these apparently distinct notions of differentiation, in the presence of a monoidal coalgebra modality, are completely equivalent. Thus, for linear logic settings, there is only one notion of differentiation. This paper also presents a number of separating examples for coalgebra modalities including examples which are and are not monoidal, as well as examples which do and do not support differential structure. Of particular interest is the observation that\textemdash somewhat counter-intuitively\textemdash differential algebras never induce a differential category although they provide a monoidal coalgebra modality. On the other hand, Rota\textendash Baxter algebras\textemdash which are usually associated with integration\textemdash provide an example of a differential category which has a non-monoidal coalgebra modality.},

Using the formalisation of our results, we perform normalisation-by-evaluation, verification and synthesis of reversible logic gates, motivated by examples from quantum computing.

This paper describes how one can define bag equivalence as the presence of bijections between sets of membership proofs. This definition has some desirable properties: Many bag equivalences can be proved using a flexible form of equational reasoning. The definition generalises easily to arbitrary unary containers, including types with infinite values, such as streams. By using a slight variation of the definition one gets set equivalence instead, i.e. equality up to order and multiplicity. Other variations give the subset and subbag preorders. The definition works well in mechanised proofs.},

We use higher inductive types to define the type K(A) of "finite sets over type A" \`a la Kuratowski without assuming that K(A) has decidable equality. We show how to define basic functions and prove basic properties after which we give two applications of our definition. On the foundational side, we use K to define the notions of "Kuratowski-finite type" and "Kuratowski-finite subobject", which we contrast with established notions, e.g. Bishop-finite types and enumerated types. We argue that Kuratowski-finiteness is the most general and flexible one of those and we define the usual operations on finite types and subobjects. From the computational perspective, we show how to use K(A) for an abstract interface for well-known finite set implementations such as tree- and list-like data structures. This implies that a function defined on a concrete finite sets implementation can be obtained from a function defined on the abstract finite sets K(A) and that correctness properties are inherited. Hence, HoTT is the ideal setting for data refinement. Beside this, we define bounded quantification, which lifts a decidable property on A to one on K(A).},

This is a very natural generalisation, and one with a long history. The first person to have taken the idea seriously seems to have been Daniel Lehmann, who gave a categorical version of the Smyth power domain (Lehmann 1976). Some time after Lehmann's work, and independently of it, a number of people looked at generalisations of domains for their own sake. The most systematic was Paul Taylor, who in the late 1980s gave categorical generalisations of much of the material of his thesis, Taylor (1986), and also of much analogous Stable Domain Theory. This work is largely unpublished, but some draft papers are available on Taylor's website. Other work of this period includes Coquand et al. (1989) in the stable tradition and Hyland and Pitts (1989) for the categorification of algebraic lattices.},

Equivalently, this free higher group can be defined as a higher inductive type F(A) with constructors unit: F(A), cons: A\textasciitilde F(A)\textasciitilde F(A), and conditions saying that every cons(a) is an auto-equivalence on F(A). Assuming that A is a set (i.e. satisfies the principle of unique identity proofs), we are interested in the question whether F(A) is a set as well, which is very much related to an open problem in the HoTT livre [22, Ex. 8.2]. We show an approximation to the question, namely that the fundamental groups of F(A) are trivial, i.e. that ||F(A)||1 is a set.},

  abstract = {Martin-Lof's intuitionistic type theory (Type Theory) is a formal system that serves not only as a foundation of constructive mathematics but also as a dependently typed programming language. Dependent types are types that depend on values of other types. Type Theory is based on the Curry-Howard isomorphism which relates ordinateur programs with mathematical proofs so that we can do ordinateur-aided formal reasoning and write certified programs in programming languages like Agda, Epigram etc. Martin Lof proposed two variants of Type Theory which are differentiated by the treatment of equality. In Intensional Type Theory, propositional equality defined by identity types does not imply definitional equality, and type checking is decidable. In Extensional Type Theory, propositional equality is identified with definitional equality which makes type checking undecidable. Because of the good computational properties, Intensional Type Theory is more popular, however it lacks some important extensional concepts such as functional extensionality and quotient types. This thesis is about quotient types. A quotient type is a new type whose equality is redefined by a given equivalence relation. However, in the usual formulation of Intensional Type Theory, there is no type former to create a quotient. We also lose canonicity if we add quotient types into Intensional Type Theory as axioms. In this thesis, we first investigate the expected syntax of quotient types and explain it with categorical notions. For quotients which can be represented as a setoid as well as defined as a set without a quotient type former, we propose to define an algebraic structure of quotients called definable quotients. It relates the setoid interpretation and the set definition via a normalisation function which returns a normal form (canonical choice) for each equivalence class. It can be seen as a simulation of quotient types and it helps theorem proving because we can benefit from both representations. However this approach cannot be used for all quotients. It seems that we cannot define a normalisation function for some quotients in Type Theory, e.g. Cauchy reals and finite multisets. Quotient types are indeed essential for formalisation of mathematics and reasoning of programs. Then we consider some models of Type Theory where types are interpreted as structured objects such as setoids, groupoids or weak omega-groupoids. In these models equalities are internalised into types which means that it is possible to redefine equalities. We present an implementation of Altenkirch's setoid model and show that quotient types can be defined within this model. We also describe a new extension of Martin-Lof type theory called Homotopy Type Theory where types are interpreted as weak omega-groupoids. It can be seen as a generalisation of the groupoid model which makes extensional concepts including quotient types available. We also introduce a syntactic encoding of weak omega-groupoids which can be seen as a first step towards building a weak omega-groupoids model in Intensional Type Theory. All of these implementations were performed in the dependently typed programming language Agda which is based on intensional Martin-Lof type theory.},

They have proven very fruitful for the ``synthetic'' development of homotopy theory within type theory, as well as in formalising ordinary set-level mathematics in type theory. In this papier, we construct models of a wide range of higher inductive types in a fairly wide range of settings.We introduce the notion of cell monad with parameters: a semantically-defined scheme for specifying homotopically well-behaved notions of structure. We then show that any suitable model category has weakly stable typal initial algebras for any cell monad with parameters. When combined with the local universes construction to obtain strict stability, this specialises to give models of specific higher inductive types, including spheres, the torus, pushout types, truncations, the James construction and general localisations.Our results apply in any sufficiently nice Quillen model category, including any right proper, simplicially locally cartesian closed, simplicial Cisinski model category (such as simplicial sets) and any locally presentable locally cartesian closed category (such as sets) with its trivial model structure. In particular, any locally presentable locally cartesian closed ({$\infty$}, 1)-category is presented by some model category to which our results apply.},

  abstract = {Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) is a variant of Martin-L\"of Type Theory (MLTT) developed in such a way that types can be interpreted as infinity-groupoids, where the iterated construction of identity types represents the different layers of higher path space objects. HoTT can be used as a foundation of mathematics, and the proofs produced in its language can be verified with the aid of specific proof assistant software. In this thesis, we provide a formulation and a formalization of coherence theorems for monoidal and symmetric monoidal groupoids in HoTT.    In order to design 1-types FMG(X) and FSMG(X) representing the free monoidal and the free symmetric monoidal groupoid on a 0-type X of generators, we use higher inductive types (HITs), which apply the functionality of inductive definitions to the higher groupoid structure of types given by the identity types. Coherence for monoidal groupoids is established by showing a monoidal equivalence between FMG(X) and the 0-type list(X) of lists over X. For symmetric monoidal groupoids, we prove a symmetric monoidal equivalence between FSMG(X) and a simpler HIT slist(X) based on lists, whose paths and 2-paths make for an auxiliary symmetric structure on top of the monoidal structure already present on list(X).    Part of the thesis is devoted to the proof that the subuniverse BS\_* of finite types is equivalent to the type slist(1), where 1 is the unit type, and hence that the former is a free symmetric monoidal groupoid. As an intermediate step, we show a symmetric monoidal equivalence between slist(1) and an indexed HIT del\_* of deloopings of symmetric groups. The proof of a symmetric monoidal equivalence between del\_* and BS\_* rests on a few, unformalized statements. Assuming this equivalence, we are able to prove that, in a free symmetric monoidal groupoid, all diagrams involving symmetric monoidal expressions without repetitions commute.    This work is accompanied by a ordinateur verification in the proof assistant Coq, which covers most of the results we present in this thesis.},

  abstract = {Proof assistants based on dependent type theory provide expressive languages for both programming and proving within the same system. However, all of the major implementations lack powerful extensionality principles for reasoning about equality, such as function and propositional extensionality. These principles are typically added axiomatically which disrupts the constructive properties of these systems. Cubical type theory provides a solution by giving computational meaning to Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations, in particular to the univalence axiom and higher inductive types. This papier describes an extension of the dependently typed functional programming language Agda with cubical primitives, making it into a full-blown proof assistant with native support for univalence and a general schema of higher inductive types. These new primitives make function and propositional extensionality as well as quotient types directly definable with computational content. Additionally, thanks also to copatterns, bisimilarity is equivalent to equality for coinductive types. This extends Agda with support for a wide range of extensionality principles, without sacrificing type checking and constructivity.},
