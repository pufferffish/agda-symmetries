We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and detailed comments.

It is very embarrassing that we did not know about the work of Henglein (2009), which already proves our main result.
Even though we gave several talks about this work before the submission, no one had pointed it out to us. After going
through the literature ourselves, we only found a connection to a proof in a paper by Henglein and Hinze (2013), which
is mentioned on line 1187.

In light of this, there is essentially nothing new in the paper other than a categorical framework and a formalization
in Agda. Therefore, we have decided to withdraw the paper. We apologize for the oversight, and thank the reviewers and
program committee for their time.
