  abstract  = {We show how types of free idempotent commutative monoids and free commutative monoids can be constructed in ordinary dependent type theory, without the need for quotient types or setoids, and prove that these constructions realise finite sets and multisets, respectively. Both constructions arise as generalisations of C. Coquand’s data type of fresh lists. We also show how many other free structures also can be realised by other instantiations. All of our results have been formalised in Agda.},

  abstract  = {Two lists are bag equivalent if they are permutations of each other, i.e. if they contain the same elements, with the same multiplicity, but perhaps not in the same order. This paper describes how one can define bag equivalence as the presence of bijections between sets of membership proofs. This definition has some desirable properties: Many bag equivalences can be proved using a flexible form of equational reasoning.The definition generalises easily to arbitrary unary containers, including types with infinite values, such as streams.By using a slight variation of the definition one gets set equivalence instead, i.e. equality up to order and multiplicity. Other variations give the subset and subbag preorders.The definition works well in mechanised proofs.},
