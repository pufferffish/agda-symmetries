We can define the type of integers as signed natural numbers (i.e., using a coproduct), but its induction principle is very inconvenient to work with, since it leads to an explosion of cases. An alternative is to use set-quotients, but here we need to use set-truncation to avoid non-trivial higher equalities. This results in a recursion principle that only allows us to define function into sets (types satisfying {UIP}). In this paper we consider higher inductive types using either a small universe or bi-invertible maps. These types represent integers without explicit set-truncation that are equivalent to the usual coproduct representation. This is an interesting example since it shows how some coherence problems can be handled in {HoTT}. We discuss some open questions triggered by this work. The proofs have been formally verified using cubical Agda.},

This has given rise to an informal notion of duality among sorting algorithms: insertion sorts are dual to selection sorts. Using bialgebras and distributive laws, we formalise this notion within a categorical setting. We use types as a guiding force in exposing the recursive structure of bubble, insertion, selection, quick, tree, and heap sorts. Moreover, we show how to distill the computational essence of these algorithms down to one-step operations that are expressed as natural transformations. From this vantage point, the duality is clear, and one side of the algorithmic coin will neatly lead us to the other "for free". As an optimisation, the approach is also extended to paramorphisms and apomorphisms, which allow for more efficient implementations of these algorithms than the corresponding folds and unfolds.},

However, in this paper I shall consider generalisations in a diﬀerent spirit from any of the above: viz the generalisation from domains as posets to domains as categories. This is a very natural generalisation, and one with a long history. The ﬁrst person to have taken the idea seriously seems to have been Daniel Lehmann, who gave a categorical version of the Smyth power domain (Lehmann 1976). Some time after Lehmann’s work, and independently of it, a number of people looked at generalisations of domains for their own sake. The most systematic was Paul Taylor, who in the late 1980s gave categorical generalisations of much of the material of his thesis, Taylor (1986), and also of much analogous Stable Domain Theory. This work is largely unpublished, but some draft papers are available on Taylor’s website. Other work of this period includes Coquand et al. (1989) in the stable tradition and Hyland and Pitts (1989) for the categoriﬁcation of algebraic lattices.},

They have proven very fruitful for the “synthetic” development of homotopy theory within type theory, as well as in formalising ordinary set-level mathematics in type theory. In this paper, we construct models of a wide range of higher inductive types in a fairly wide range of settings.We introduce the notion of cell monad with parameters: a semantically-defined scheme for specifying homotopically well-behaved notions of structure. We then show that any suitable model category has weakly stable typal initial algebras for any cell monad with parameters. When combined with the local universes construction to obtain strict stability, this specialises to give models of specific higher inductive types, including spheres, the torus, pushout types, truncations, the James construction and general localisations.Our results apply in any sufficiently nice Quillen model category, including any right proper, simplicially locally cartesian closed, simplicial Cisinski model category (such as simplicial sets) and any locally presentable locally cartesian closed category (such as sets) with its trivial model structure. In particular, any locally presentable locally cartesian closed (∞, 1)-category is presented by some model category to which our results apply.},

We establish a correspondence between the syntactic groupoid of the language and a formally presented univalent subuniverse of finite types. The correspondence relates 1-combinators to 1-paths, and 2-combinators to 2-paths in the universe, which is shown to be sound and complete for both levels, forming an equivalence of groupoids. We use this to establish a Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence between Reversible Logic, Reversible Programming Languages, and Symmetric Rig Groupoids, by showing that the syntax of Pi is presented by the free symmetric rig groupoid, given by finite sets and bijections. Using the formalisation of our results, we perform normalisation-by-evaluation, verification and synthesis of reversible logic gates, motivated by examples from quantum computing.

	title = {Quotient types in type theory},
	url = {http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/28941/},
	abstract = {Martin-Lof's intuitionistic type theory (Type Theory) is a formal system that serves not only as a foundation of constructive mathematics but also as a dependently typed programming language. Dependent types are types that depend on values of other types. Type Theory is based on the Curry-Howard isomorphism which relates computer programs with mathematical proofs so that we can do computer-aided formal reasoning and write certified programs in programming languages like Agda, Epigram etc. Martin Lof proposed two variants of Type Theory which are differentiated by the treatment of equality. In Intensional Type Theory, propositional equality defined by identity types does not imply definitional equality, and type checking is decidable. In Extensional Type Theory, propositional equality is identified with definitional equality which makes type checking undecidable. Because of the good computational properties, Intensional Type Theory is more popular, however it lacks some important extensional concepts such as functional extensionality and quotient types.
This thesis is about quotient types. A quotient type is a new type whose equality is redefined by a given equivalence relation. However, in the usual formulation of Intensional Type Theory, there is no type former to create a quotient. We also lose canonicity if we add quotient types into Intensional Type Theory as axioms. In this thesis, we first investigate the expected syntax of quotient types and explain it with categorical notions. For quotients which can be represented as a setoid as well as defined as a set without a quotient type former, we propose to define an algebraic structure of quotients called definable quotients. It relates the setoid interpretation and the set definition via a normalisation function which returns a normal form (canonical choice) for each equivalence class. It can be seen as a simulation of quotient types and it helps theorem proving because we can benefit from both representations. However this approach cannot be used for all quotients. It seems that we cannot define a normalisation function for some quotients in Type Theory, e.g. Cauchy reals and finite multisets. Quotient types are indeed essential for formalisation of mathematics and reasoning of programs. Then we consider some models of Type Theory where types are interpreted as structured objects such as setoids, groupoids or weak omega-groupoids. In these models equalities are internalised into types which means that it is possible to redefine equalities. We present an implementation of Altenkirch's setoid model and show that quotient types can be defined within this model. We also describe a new extension of Martin-Lof type theory called Homotopy Type Theory where types are interpreted as weak omega-groupoids. It can be seen as a generalisation of the groupoid model which makes extensional concepts including quotient types available. We also introduce a syntactic encoding of weak omega-groupoids which can be seen as a first step towards building a weak omega-groupoids model in Intensional Type Theory. All of these implementations were performed in the dependently typed programming language Agda which is based on intensional Martin-Lof type theory.},

	abstract = {This paper studies fundamental connections between profunctors (that is, distributors, or bimodules), open maps and bisimulation. In particular, it proves that a colimit preserving functor between presheaf categories (corresponding to a profunctor) preserves open maps and open map bisimulation. Consequently, the composition of profunctors preserves open maps as 2-cells. A guiding idea is the view that profunctors, and colimit preserving functors, are linear maps in a model of classical linear logic. But profunctors, and colimit preserving functors, as linear maps, are too restrictive for many applications. This leads to a study of a range of pseudo-comonads and of how non-linear maps in their co-Kleisli bicategories preserve open maps and bisimulation. The pseudo-comonads considered are based on finite colimit completion, ‘lifting’, and indexed families. The paper includes an appendix summarising the key results on coends, left Kan extensions and the preservation of colimits. One motivation for this work is that it provides a mathematical framework for extending domain theory and denotational semantics of programming languages to the more intricate models, languages and equivalences found in concurrent computation, but the results are likely to have more general applicability because of the ubiquitous nature of profunctors.},

Recent work in proof assistants has shown that Voevodsky's univalence principle allows transferring theorems between isomorphic types, but many instances of representation independence in programming involve non-isomorphic representations. In this paper, we develop techniques for establishing internal relational representation independence results in dependent type theory, by using higher inductive types to simultaneously quotient two related implementation types by a heterogeneous correspondence between them. The correspondence becomes an isomorphism between the quotiented types, thereby allowing us to obtain an equality of implementations by univalence. We illustrate our techniques by considering applications to matrices, queues, and finite multisets. Our results are all formalized in Cubical Agda, a recent extension of Agda which supports univalence and higher inductive types in a computationally well-behaved way.},

In this paper, we consider a programming application of higher inductive types. Version control systems such as Darcs are based on the notion of patches—syntactic representations of edits to a repository. We show how patch theory can be developed in homotopy type theory. Our formulation separates formal theories of patches from their interpretation as edits to repositories. A patch theory is presented as a higher inductive type. Models of a patch theory are given by maps out of that type, which, being functors, automatically preserve the structure of patches.

Assuming that A is a set (i.e. satisfies the principle of unique identity proofs), we are interested in the question whether F(A) is a set as well, which is very much related to an open problem in the {HoTT} book [22, Ex. 8.2]. We show an approximation to the question, namely that the fundamental groups of F(A) are trivial, i.e. that {\textbar}{\textbar}F(A){\textbar}{\textbar}1 is a set.},

We use higher inductive types to define the type K(A) of "finite sets over type A" à la Kuratowski without assuming that K(A) has decidable equality. We show how to define basic functions and prove basic properties after which we give two applications of our definition. On the foundational side, we use K to define the notions of "Kuratowski-finite type" and "Kuratowski-finite subobject", which we contrast with established notions, e.g. Bishop-finite types and enumerated types. We argue that Kuratowski-finiteness is the most general and flexible one of those and we define the usual operations on finite types and subobjects. From the computational perspective, we show how to use K(A) for an abstract interface for well-known finite set implementations such as tree- and list-like data structures. This implies that a function defined on a concrete finite sets implementation can be obtained from a function defined on the abstract finite sets K(A) and that correctness properties are inherited. Hence, {HoTT} is the ideal setting for data refinement. Beside this, we define bounded quantification, which lifts a decidable property on A to one on K(A).},

combinatorial properties of finite multisets. These properties are established
in full generality without assuming decidable equality on the carrier set.
  As an application, we present a constructive formalisation of the relational
model of classical linear logic and its differential structure. This leads to
constructively establishing that free commutative monoids are conical
refinement monoids. Thereon we obtain a characterisation of the equality type
of finite multisets and a new presentation of the free commutative-monoid
construction as a set-quotient of the list construction. These developments
crucially rely on the commutation relation of creation/annihilation operators
associated with the free commutative-monoid construction seen as a

In such a category one should imagine the morphisms in the base category as being linear maps and the morphisms in the {coKleisli} category as being smooth (infinitely differentiable). Although such categories do not necessarily arise from models of linear logic, one should think of this as replacing the usual dichotomy of linear vs. stable maps established for coherence spaces.After establishing the basic axioms, we give a number of examples. The most important example arises from a general construction, a comonad \$S\_{\textbackslash}infty\$ on the category of vector spaces. This comonad and associated differential operators fully capture the usual notion of derivatives of smooth maps. Finally, we derive additional properties of differential categories in certain special cases, especially when the comonad is a storage modality, as in linear logic. In particular, we introduce the notion of a categorical model of the differential calculus, and show that it captures the not-necessarily-closed fragment of Ehrhard–Regnier differential \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-calculus.},

If states are reachable in multiple ways, coalgebras for the finite bag functor provide a more faithful representation. The final coalgebra of this functor is employed as a denotational domain for the evaluation of such systems. Elements of the final coalgebra are non-wellfounded trees with finite unordered branching, representing the evolution of systems starting from a given initial state.
This paper is dedicated to the construction of the final coalgebra of the finite bag functor in homotopy type theory ({HoTT}). We first compare various equivalent definitions of finite bags employing higher inductive types, both as sets and as groupoids (in the sense of {HoTT}). We then analyze a few well-known, classical set-theoretic constructions of final coalgebras in our constructive setting. We show that, in the case of set-based definitions of finite bags, some constructions are intrinsically classical, in the sense that they are equivalent to some weak form of excluded middle. Nevertheless, a type satisfying the universal property of the final coalgebra can be constructed in {HoTT} employing the groupoid-based definition of finite bags. We conclude by discussing generalizations of our constructions to the wider class of analytic functors.},

Here we revisit the formalism and, in particular, examine the two different approaches to defining differentiation which were introduced. The basic approach used a deriving transformation, while a more refined approach, in the presence of a bialgebra modality, used a codereliction. The latter approach is particularly relevant to linear logic settings, where the coalgebra modality is monoidal and the Seely isomorphisms give rise to a bialgebra modality. Here, we prove that these apparently distinct notions of differentiation, in the presence of a monoidal coalgebra modality, are completely equivalent. Thus, for linear logic settings, there is only one notion of differentiation. This paper also presents a number of separating examples for coalgebra modalities including examples which are and are not monoidal, as well as examples which do and do not support differential structure. Of particular interest is the observation that—somewhat counter-intuitively—differential algebras never induce a differential category although they provide a monoidal coalgebra modality. On the other hand, Rota–Baxter algebras—which are usually associated with integration—provide an example of a differential category which has a non-monoidal coalgebra modality.},

Cubical type theory provides a solution by giving computational meaning to Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations, in particular to the univalence axiom and higher inductive types. This paper describes an extension of the dependently typed functional programming language Agda with cubical primitives, making it into a full-blown proof assistant with native support for univalence and a general schema of higher inductive types. These new primitives make function and propositional extensionality as well as quotient types directly definable with computational content. Additionally, thanks also to copatterns, bisimilarity is equivalent to equality for coinductive types.

	abstract = {Homotopy Type Theory ({HoTT}) is a variant of Martin-Löf Type Theory ({MLTT}) developed in such a way that types can be interpreted as infinity-groupoids, where the iterated construction of identity types represents the different layers of higher path space objects. {HoTT} can be used as a foundation of mathematics, and the proofs produced in its language can be verified with the aid of specific proof assistant software. In this thesis, we provide a formulation and a formalization of coherence theorems for monoidal and symmetric monoidal groupoids in {HoTT}. 
 
In order to design 1-types {FMG}(X) and {FSMG}(X) representing the free monoidal and the free symmetric monoidal groupoid on a 0-type X of generators, we use higher inductive types ({HITs}), which apply the functionality of inductive definitions to the higher groupoid structure of types given by the identity types. Coherence for monoidal groupoids is established by showing a monoidal equivalence between {FMG}(X) and the 0-type list(X) of lists over X. For symmetric monoidal groupoids, we prove a symmetric monoidal equivalence between {FSMG}(X) and a simpler {HIT} slist(X) based on lists, whose paths and 2-paths make for an auxiliary symmetric structure on top of the monoidal structure already present on list(X). 
 
Part of the thesis is devoted to the proof that the subuniverse {BS}\_* of finite types is equivalent to the type slist(1), where 1 is the unit type, and hence that the former is a free symmetric monoidal groupoid. As an intermediate step, we show a symmetric monoidal equivalence between slist(1) and an indexed {HIT} del\_* of deloopings of symmetric groups. The proof of a symmetric monoidal equivalence between del\_* and {BS}\_* rests on a few, unformalized statements. Assuming this equivalence, we are able to prove that, in a free symmetric monoidal groupoid, all diagrams involving symmetric monoidal expressions without repetitions commute. 
 
This work is accompanied by a computer verification in the proof assistant Coq, which covers most of the results we present in this thesis.},

	abstract = {Two lists are bag equivalent if they are permutations of each other, i.e. if they contain the same elements, with the same multiplicity, but perhaps not in the same order. This paper describes how one can define bag equivalence as the presence of bijections between sets of membership proofs. This definition has some desirable properties: Many bag equivalences can be proved using a flexible form of equational reasoning. The definition generalises easily to arbitrary unary containers, including types with infinite values, such as streams. By using a slight variation of the definition one gets set equivalence instead, i.e. equality up to order and multiplicity. Other variations give the subset and subbag preorders. The definition works well in mechanised proofs.},

	abstract = {Many problems lead to the consideration of “algebras”, given by an object A of a category A together with “actions” {TkA} → A on A of one or more endofunctors of A, subjected to equational axioms. Such problems include those of free monads and free monoids, of cocompleteness in categories of monads and of monoids, of orthogonal subcategories (= generalized sheaf-categories), of categories of continuous functors, and so on; apart from problems involving the algebras for their own sake.Desirable properties of the category of algebras - existence of free ones, cocompleteness, existence of adjoints to algebraic functors - all follow if this category can be proved reflective in some well-behaved category: for which we choose a certain comma-category T/{AWe} show that the reflexion exists and is given as the colimit of a simple transfinite sequence, if A is cocomplete and the Tk preserve either colimits or unions of suitably-long chains of subobjects.The article draws heavily on the work of earlier authors, unifies and simplifies this, and extends it to new problems. Moreover the reflectivity in T/A is stronger than any earlier result, and will be applied in forthcoming articles, in an enriched version, to the study of categories with structure.},
